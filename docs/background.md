## Tough History

Alexandra was a happy violinist with a family. Back then, Alexander had a
beautiful wife and two beautiful little girls. Alexander would play and sing
at the local tavern, earning a good living for his family.

However, one eventful night, while at the tavern, an argument broke out
between a large party. They were drunk and unruly and things got out of hand
quickly. As Alexander tried to calm down the drunk group, one of them absent
mindedly used some kind of powerful magic (perhaps a wish) to transform
Alexander into a female as the man taunted Alexander for being such a sissy.
This group was identified as being part of Acquisitions Incorporated.


Shortly after this accident, Alexander attempted to continue with her life.
However, the magic had caused her to lose her skills and popularity, having
to adjust to a new body. She was an unknown, having to rebuild all that she
had previously.


This collapse caused her family to have financial issues. During this time,
Alexander attempted to sue Acquisitions Incorporated for the financial and
emotional pain that had been placed on Alexander and her family. The lawsuit
went on for years without an end in sight.


The financial and emotional pressure put on Alexander's family, from outside
sources and Alexander trying to find a permanent solution caused her family to
lose hope. After multiple court extensions and delays and living with the
results of that day for just over 3 years, pressure finally overcame
Alexander's wife. She had turned to alcohol, and she and the daughters fell
victim to a house fire. It is believed that the fire was started by Alexander's
wife. It is unknown if it was an accident or perhaps the result of overwhelming
depression and frustration she had been under due to this series of events or
the past years.


Shortly after the fire, Acquisitions Incorporated attempted to deal with
Alexander quickly and quietly. Alexander was granted a position at a new
branch, opening in Nightstone as the decisionist "leader". A position they
said she would fit in perfectly and have a chance to relearn her skills and
unlock her potential. She would change her name and is expected to bury the
incident behind her. Alexandra Liadon now finds herself traveling to take on
this new job a few months later, with nothing more than what she carries on
her back.


Her family and home now buried behind her. She had searched tirelessly for a
solution, but now questions whether it matters now anymore. Even if she could
unlock her full potential now, the her world has become so chaotic, perhaps she
will have to live with what has already happened.
